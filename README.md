A quality of life module that makes applying damage to targets and tracking saving throws easier in the Pathfinder 2e system.
A direct successor to [target-lock](https://github.com/WillNichols726/target-lock), at first a copy and then having been rewritten from the ground up.

**As of version 2.4, the module is in a FINISHED state, meaning that the only likely updates to this module will be bug-fixes**. So while I appreciate new suggestions, please note they are not going to be worked in anytime soon!
